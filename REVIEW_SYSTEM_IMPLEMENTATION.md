# Review Configuration & Scoring System - Implementation Plan

## Phase Overview
This document outlines the implementation of a comprehensive review configuration and scoring system for the Convene workshop administration platform. The system will enable program administrators to define custom scoring rubrics, configure review workflows, and ensure consistent, fair evaluation of applications.

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components
1. **Database Layer**: PostgreSQL tables for review configuration, scoring rubrics, and reviewer management
2. **API Layer**: RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations on review settings
3. **UI Layer**: Review configuration tab in program management interface
4. **Business Logic**: Scoring calculations, conflict detection, and auto-decision logic

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Database Schema (Current)
**Timeline**: Immediate
**Objective**: Create foundational database structure for review system

#### Tables to Create:
1. `review_criteria` - Defines scoring criteria and rubrics
2. `review_scores` - Stores individual criterion scores
3. `review_settings` - Program-level review configuration
4. `reviewer_expertise` - Tracks reviewer qualifications
5. `review_criteria_templates` - Pre-built rubrics for common use cases

#### Key Features:
- Weighted scoring with customizable scales
- JSON storage for detailed rubric guidelines
- Support for multiple scoring types (numeric, yes/no, pass/fail)
- Inter-table relationships with proper cascading

### Phase 2: API Development
**Timeline**: After Phase 1
**Objective**: Build RESTful API for review configuration management

#### Endpoints:
```
/api/programs/:id/review-settings
/api/programs/:id/review-criteria
/api/reviews/:id/scores
/api/programs/:id/review-analytics
```

#### Features:
- CRUD operations for all review entities
- Batch operations for efficiency
- Real-time score calculations
- Validation and error handling

### Phase 3: UI Implementation
**Timeline**: After Phase 2
**Objective**: Create intuitive interface for review configuration

#### Components:
1. Review Settings Tab in program edit interface
2. Criteria builder with drag-and-drop reordering

4. Visual score weight distribution
5. Preview of reviewer interface

#### User Experience:
- Guided setup wizard for first-time configuration
- Visual feedback for weight distribution
- Real-time validation of settings
- Copy settings from previous programs

### Phase 4: Scoring Engine
**Timeline**: After Phase 3
**Objective**: Implement scoring calculation and decision logic

#### Features:
1. **Score Calculation Methods**:
   - Average scoring
   - Weighted average
   - Median scoring
   - Consensus-based scoring

2. **Auto-Decision Logic**:
   - Threshold-based accept/reject
   - Waitlist management
   - Conflict detection and escalation

3. **Analytics & Reporting**:
   - Score distribution visualization
   - Inter-rater reliability metrics
   - Reviewer performance tracking

### Phase 5: Advanced Features
**Timeline**: Future enhancement
**Objective**: Add sophisticated review capabilities

#### Features:
1. **Calibration System**:
   - Practice reviews for training
   - Scorer reliability testing
   - Bias detection algorithms

2. **Review Workflow Automation**:
   - Smart reviewer assignment based on expertise
   - Workload balancing
   - Deadline management and reminders

3. **Integration Features**:
   - Export to external review systems
   - Bulk import of reviewer decisions
   - API for third-party integrations

## Technical Specifications

### Database Schema Details

#### review_criteria
```sql
- id: UUID (Primary Key)
- program_id: UUID (Foreign Key → programs)
- name: TEXT (Required)
- description: TEXT
- weight: DECIMAL(3,2) (0.00-1.00)
- max_score: INTEGER
- order_index: INTEGER
- is_required: BOOLEAN
- scoring_type: ENUM ('numeric', 'yes_no', 'pass_fail', 'letter_grade')
- rubric_guidelines: JSONB
- created_at: TIMESTAMPTZ
- updated_at: TIMESTAMPTZ
```

#### review_scores
```sql
- id: UUID (Primary Key)
- review_id: UUID (Foreign Key → reviews)
- criteria_id: UUID (Foreign Key → review_criteria)
- score: DECIMAL(5,2)
- normalized_score: DECIMAL(5,2)
- comments: TEXT
- confidence_level: INTEGER (1-5)
- created_at: TIMESTAMPTZ
```

#### review_settings
```sql
- id: UUID (Primary Key)
- program_id: UUID (Foreign Key → programs, UNIQUE)
- min_reviews_required: INTEGER
- max_reviews_allowed: INTEGER
- review_deadline_days: INTEGER
- scoring_method: ENUM ('average', 'median', 'highest', 'consensus')
- score_threshold_accept: DECIMAL(5,2)
- score_threshold_reject: DECIMAL(5,2)
- Additional configuration fields...
```

### Security Considerations

1. **Row Level Security (RLS)**:
   - Only program admins can modify review settings
   - Reviewers can only see/edit their assigned reviews
   - Applicants cannot access review data

2. **Data Privacy**:
   - Blind review mode hides applicant identity
   - Reviewer comments sanitized before display
   - Audit trail for all review actions

3. **Validation**:
   - Weight sum validation (must equal 100%)
   - Score range validation
   - Prevent deletion of criteria with existing scores

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Indexes**:
   - program_id on all tables for fast filtering
   - review_id + criteria_id composite index on review_scores
   - order_index for efficient sorting

2. **Caching Strategy**:
   - Cache rubric templates
   - Cache calculated scores with invalidation on update
   - Batch operations for bulk scoring

3. **Query Optimization**:
   - Materialized views for analytics
   - Efficient aggregation queries for scoring
   - Pagination for large review sets

## Success Metrics

1. **Technical Metrics**:
   - API response time < 200ms
   - Score calculation time < 100ms
   - 99.9% uptime for review system

2. **User Metrics**:
   - 80% of programs use custom rubrics
   - 50% reduction in review time
   - 90% reviewer satisfaction score

3. **Quality Metrics**:
   - Inter-rater reliability > 0.8
   - < 5% of decisions require manual override
   - 95% of reviews completed on time

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Data Loss**: Regular backups, soft deletes for critical data
2. **Scoring Errors**: Comprehensive testing, calculation verification
3. **User Confusion**: Clear documentation, inline help, tutorials
4. **Performance Issues**: Load testing, query optimization, caching
5. **Security Breaches**: Regular security audits, penetration testing

## Migration Strategy

1. **Backward Compatibility**:
   - Existing reviews continue to function
   - Optional migration tool for old data
   - Gradual rollout with feature flags

2. **Data Migration**:
   - Script to create default rubrics for existing programs
   - Preserve existing review data
   - Map old scoring to new system
