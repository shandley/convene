# Startup Hook Configuration Fix

## Problem
The startup-prime.sh hook was not running automatically when Claude Code sessions started, requiring manual execution.

## Solution
Created `.claude/settings.json` with proper SessionStart hook configuration:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      {
        "matcher": "startup",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash .claude/hooks/startup-prime.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Key Points
1. **Configuration File**: `.claude/settings.json` (not settings.local.json) is the correct file for hook configuration
2. **Hook Type**: Use `SessionStart` with `"matcher": "startup"` for automatic execution
3. **Command Path**: Specify relative path from project root: `bash .claude/hooks/startup-prime.sh`
4. **Permissions**: The hook file already has executable permissions (755)

## Testing
To test this configuration:
1. End your current Claude Code session
2. Start a new session in this directory
3. The startup hook should run automatically and prime Claude with project context

## What the Hook Does
- Loads CLAUDE.md for project context
- Gathers git status and recent changes
- Detects configured MCP servers
- Creates a prime request with all context
- Makes Claude aware of specialized subagents

This ensures Claude starts each session with full project awareness.
