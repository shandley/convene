# Fixing Email Confirmation Infinite Loading Issue

## Problem
When users click email confirmation links, they get stuck on an infinite "Loading..." page instead of being properly redirected and confirmed.

## Root Cause
The issue occurs because:
1. Supabase sends verification emails with direct links to their hosted endpoint (`https://supabase.co/auth/v1/verify`)
2. The redirect URL in these links points to our app root (`/`) instead of our auth callback route (`/auth/callback`)
3. Our app doesn't properly handle the auth parameters when redirected from Supabase

## Solution

### 1. Configure Supabase Redirect URLs

Go to your [Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → URL Configuration](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/url-configuration) and:

#### Site URL
Set to your production URL:
```
https://workshop-adminstration-site.vercel.app
```

#### Additional Redirect URLs
Add these URLs to handle different environments:
```
http://localhost:3000/auth/callback
https://workshop-adminstration-site.vercel.app/auth/callback
https://*-your-vercel-team.vercel.app/auth/callback
```

### 2. Update Email Templates

Go to [Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Email Templates](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/templates) and update the confirmation email template:

#### Find this line:
```html
<a href="{{ .SiteURL }}/auth/confirm?token_hash={{ .TokenHash }}&type=email">Confirm your mail</a>
```

#### Replace with:
```html
<a href="{{ .SiteURL }}/auth/callback?token_hash={{ .TokenHash }}&type=signup&next=/programs">Confirm your mail</a>
```

### 3. Alternative: Use RedirectTo in Templates

If you want more control, you can also use:
```html
<a href="{{ .RedirectTo }}?token_hash={{ .TokenHash }}&type=signup&next=/programs">Confirm your mail</a>
```

This uses the `redirectTo` parameter from the signup call.

## How The Fixed Flow Works

1. **User signs up** → Email sent with link to `/auth/callback?token_hash=...&type=signup`
2. **User clicks link** → Redirected to our app's callback route
3. **Callback route** processes the token and verifies the email
4. **User redirected** to login page with success message
5. **User can now sign in** with verified email

## Code Changes Made

### Updated `/app/page.tsx`
- Added proper handling of auth callback parameters from URL
- Added loading states for email verification
- Added success/error message display
- Improved user experience during verification process

### Updated `/app/auth/callback/route.ts`
- Added support for legacy `token` parameter (for backward compatibility)
- Improved error handling and logging
- Better redirect logic for email confirmation vs other auth flows

### Updated `/lib/auth/context.tsx`
- Added comprehensive error handling in auth state management
- Added logging for debugging auth issues
- Improved session detection and profile loading

## Testing the Fix

1. **Sign up with a new email address**
2. **Check your email** for the confirmation link
3. **Click the confirmation link** - should show "Verifying your email..." briefly
4. **Should redirect to login** with success message "Email verified! Please sign in to continue."
5. **Sign in** with your credentials - should work normally

## Environment Variables Needed

Make sure these are set correctly:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://workshop-adminstration-site.vercel.app
NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_URL=(automatically set by Vercel)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://mfwionthxrjauwhvwcqw.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

## Debugging

If issues persist, check browser network tab and server logs for:
- Auth callback route being called
- Token verification attempts
- Error messages from Supabase
- Redirect chains

The callback route now logs all attempts for easier debugging.
